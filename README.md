Hi,

My ReadMe will not e updated for the Capstone project.  There is no way I can complete my project to meet the necessary requirements and that is on me. I appreciate Code:You and all I have learned during my cohort.  I'm am aware that, for the forseeable future, there will be no more opportunities for NKY students after this cohort. With that being said I will continue learning on my own and complete this project and more for myself and continue working towards transitioning into the tech industry.

Thank You
