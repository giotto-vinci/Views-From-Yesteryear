Hi,

I'm Roderick. This will be the repository for my Capstone Project.  The focus is an intuitive app to view major artworks throughout history.  The goal is to have the the visual artwork as the focus, while being organized by art movements as the default, or by artist, style, or century depending on the user's preference. I plan to use the Wikipedia API to give people the opportunity to go directly from any work that interests them to detailed information in regard to the artist, style, or movement. My repo, [Praxi-2](https://github.com/giotto-vinci/Praxi-2), shows a very, very, rough idea of what I am planning.

Thank You
